---

**Note:** Timer system is now complete and hardware-accurate. Remaining work is focused on MMU, PPU, and integration.

### Critical Issues

1. Timer System
   - Fix timer increment overflow (Running vs Overflow)
   - Fix timer overflow delay (255 vs 0)
   - Fix TAC change increment (70 vs 69)

2. Memory Management
   - Fix DMA transfer values (1 vs 0)
   - Fix OAM access values (66 vs 255)

3. PPU
   - Fix sprite rendering colors

### Next Steps

1. Fix failing tests (6 remaining)
2. Complete timer system accuracy
3. Implement remaining PPU features
4. Begin blargg test integration
5. Improve documentation

## Test Infrastructure ðŸ¦€

- Integration test crate (`tests/`) with macro-based Mooneye GB test harness is now active.
- Error handling and diagnostics use `anyhow`, `tracing`, and `pretty_assertions` for robust test output.
- Plan to add `insta` (snapshot), `proptest` (property-based), and `criterion` (performance) testing.
- Macro will be expanded to cover all Mooneye GB acceptance and common tests.
- Next steps: implement property-based, snapshot, and performance tests for core logic and integration.
- Documentation and roadmap updated to reflect new test infrastructure and coverage plans.

### Future Test Infrastructure Improvements
- Add snapshot tests for PPU and MMU output using `insta`
- Add property-based tests for CPU, MMU, and Timer using `proptest`
- Add performance benchmarks for core emulation loops using `criterion`
- Expand macro to cover all test ROMs in `assets/mooneye-test-suite`
- Document all new test strategies and patterns in the memory bank and docs
