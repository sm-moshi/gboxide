# gboxide Roadmap

## Current Status (2025-04)

âœ… **Core Systems Complete and Audited**
- All core modules (CPU, MMU, Timer, PPU, APU, Cartridge, Interrupts, Bus, Helpers) are fully audited
- Codebase is warning-free and all tests pass
- Test code is idiomatic (no unwrap()/expect())
- Documentation is up to date
- The only remaining warnings are in test-only code and are suppressed with #[allow(dead_code)]

### Core Module Status

- [x] Cartridge support (MBC1/2/3/5 + RTC, tests pass)
- [x] Interrupts (Hardware accurate timing, tests pass)
- [x] Bus (Routes IO, tests pass)
- [x] Helpers (Audited, tests pass)
- [x] PPU implementation
  - [x] Basic BG/Window Rendering & Timings
  - [x] Basic Sprite Rendering Logic
