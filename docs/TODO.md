## Current Status Notes

- All core modules (CPU, MMU, Timer, APU, Cartridge, Interrupts, Bus, Helpers) are fully audited, warning-free, and pass their tests
- All PPU sprite logic now passes; focus is on advanced PPU features, CGB support, and test coverage
- APU module is fully audited, warning-free, and all tests pass
- The only remaining warnings are in test-only code and are suppressed with #[allow(dead_code)]
- Test coverage is good for core modules and improved for PPU (84%) and sprite system (100%)
- Integration test crate with macro-based Mooneye GB test harness is active
- Error handling uses anyhow, tracing, and pretty_assertions
- Current focus is on:
  1. Implementing advanced PPU features
  2. Adding GBC support
  3. Expanding test coverage
  4. Improving debugging capabilities
