### Fixed

- Timer system: State machine, overflow delay, and edge case handling (DIV reset, TAC change, overflow cancellation) are now correct and cycle-accurate
- All timer-specific tests now pass, confirming hardware-accurate behaviour for overflow and cancellation
- Test harness now explicitly sets up DIV and steps cycles to guarantee edge-triggered behaviour, ensuring robust and accurate test coverage
- Remaining test failures are outside the timer (MMU, PPU)
- Flag handling in ADD HL,rr instruction
- Redundant ALU operation blocks removed
- Duplicate macro definitions consolidated
- Register operation consistency
- Stack operation timing
- Memory access patterns
- Debug output formatting
- Echo RAM mirroring implementation
- OAM access and protection
- Memory bank controller switching
- Timer accuracy and integration
