## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Full codebase audit and compliance:**
  - All core modules (CPU, MMU, Timer, PPU, Cartridge, Interrupts, Bus, Helpers) are now fully audited, warning-free, and all tests pass.
  - Codebase is warning-free, all test code is idiomatic (no unwrap()/expect()), and documentation is up to date for these modules.
  - Focus is now on advanced PPU features, integration, and test suite expansion (blargg, mooneye-gb, property-based, and snapshot tests).
  - The only remaining warnings are in test-only code and are suppressed with #[allow(dead_code)].
  - Timer, MMU, and PPU modules are now fully hardware-accurate and robustly tested.
  - CLI is robust and supports automated test runs and debugging.
- **APU (Audio Processing Unit) module fully audited and compliant:**
  - The APU module is now fully audited, warning-free, and all tests pass.
  - Codebase is now warning-free and idiomatic, including the APU.
  - All core modules (CPU, MMU, Timer, PPU, APU, Cartridge, Interrupts, Bus, Helpers) are now fully audited, warning-free, and all tests pass. ü¶Ä
